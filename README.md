# Machine Learning
## Course about Machine Learning
## ML Models in project:
- Lab-1: searching for best batch size for regressions
- Lab-2: inceptionV3 model to classify car colors
- Lab-3-easy: roBERTa model to predict location of action in text
- Lab-4: model for playing Breakout
- Lab-5-easy: importance comparison of 5+ different hyperparameters
- Lab-5-hard: vector representation of a neural network 
- Task-1: comparison of different activation functions ('relu', 'gelu', 'swish', 'softplus', 'tanh', 'sigmoid')
- Task-2: comparison of different optimizers ('Nesterov', 'Adam', 'RMSProp') and LR shedulers ('StepLR', 'ExponentialLR')
- Task-4: music generation using 5 different models
- Task-5: SVG-images generating using 5+ different LLMs

**Lab work scores:**
- almost all labs passed 100%
- Lab-4 passed 150% cause of its very good results
- Lab-5-hard passed only 50% cause of its restrictions

**Restrictions of improve Lab-5-hard:**
- no autoencoder (model to compress similar blocks of model)
- not possible to save 100 (more than default) layers without updating default (50 layers) size - idk how to do it
- not possible to save smth special: layers, params, etc

**There are not all tasks and labs done, but it was enough to get 91/100 score**

Good luck
